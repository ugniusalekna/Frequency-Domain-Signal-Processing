# Advanced Signal Processing in Frequency Domain
A practical task for the course Digital Signal Processing

This repository contains a tool for graphically representing audio signals and their spectra, focusing on signal processing in the frequency domain and assessing the observable and audible properties before and after processing. The project is accompanied by a report, featuring different signal processing methods in the frequency domain, illustrating original signals and processed signals, along with subjective evaluations of the perceived changes in sound.
